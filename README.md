# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
a) it is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain quality software systems.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a) rise of programming languages
b)  shift towards agile technilogies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a) Requirements: gathering and documenting user and systems needs/requirements.
b) Design: creating detailed designs of the software architecture
c) Implementation: writing code and building software
d) Testing: ensuring software is working as intentand
e) Deployment: releasing the software to users
f) Maintainance: providing ongoing support and after-service.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
a) Waterfall: sequantial approach in phases.
b) Agile: iterative and incremental approach

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) Software developer: writes code and developes software system.
b) Quality Assuarence Engineer: ensures that software products meets required stardards.
c) Project Manager: runs the life cycle of software developement ensuring that everything is in order.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a) IDEs: provide a holistic approach to development by providing all the necessary tools at one place e.g Vscode
b) VCS: helps in monitering and controlling of versions of a software program /project e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) limited resources: ensuring that all resources are availble before a project starts
b) technological changes: ensuring that they move with the times and also learning new technologies
c) conflicting requirements: ensuring that everyone is onboard when running a software project.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) Unit tesing: testing individual components of a software system.
b) Intergration testing: testing relations between different components of a system
c) System testing: testing the entire system.
d) Acceptance testing: testing sysetm against user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
a) crafting questions to get best responses from Ai models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
a) Vague prompt: Explain healthy living
b) Improved propmt: Explain the benefits of exercises and maintaining a proper diet in relation to healthy living
c) The improved prompt is more specific and has measurements set.
